### Overview  
The **Customer Intelligence System** showcases how a unified data foundation can power both **analytics and AI-driven engagement** for a retail platform like Instacart.  
It combines **customer segmentation analytics** with **AI-based retention personalization**, demonstrating how structured data and automation together enhance customer understanding and enable an AI-based solution to increase engagement.

### Core Idea  
As analytics evolves toward conversational and predictive systems, this project builds a single, well-modeled data layer (Bronze → Silver → Gold) that supports both insight generation and AI integration.  
It enables:  
- **Customer segmentation** and behavioral analysis from unified data.  
- **AI-powered personalized notifications** for retention and engagement.


### Key Highlights  
- 🧩 **Data Modeling:** Medallion Architecture with Delta tables for clean, reusable layers.  
- 📈 **Analytics:** Dashboards showing customer segments, order frequency, and activity patterns.  
- 🤖 **AI Integration:** OpenAI-based notification generator using behavioral context from the table in Gold layer.
